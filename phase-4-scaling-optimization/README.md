# Phase 4: Scaling and Optimization

Welcome to Phase 4 of the IT Study training program! This phase focuses on advanced cloud operations, including scaling techniques, cost optimization, and designing robust, production-ready systems.

## Overview

In this phase, you will learn how to:
- Design scalable architectures that handle growing demand
- Optimize costs while maintaining performance
- Implement high availability and fault tolerance
- Monitor and troubleshoot production systems

## Projects

### 1. PDF to JPEG Conversion System

**Location**: `pdf-to-jpeg-conversion/`

A comprehensive project that challenges you to design a scalable AWS-based system for converting large PDF files to JPEG images. This project covers:

- Event-driven serverless architectures
- Cost-effective storage strategies
- Compute resource optimization (Lambda vs EC2)
- Handling AWS service limitations
- Real-world scaling challenges
