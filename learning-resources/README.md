# Learning Resources

This directory contains supplementary learning materials designed to enhance your IT Study training experience.

## Available Resources

### [AWS Real-World Use Cases](./aws-use-cases.md)

A comprehensive guide featuring four detailed use cases that demonstrate practical applications of AWS services in real-world scenarios:

1. **Document Conversion and Storage** - Learn serverless architectures with AWS Lambda and S3
2. **Scalable Web Application Deployment** - Master Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and high availability
3. **Data Analysis and Reporting** - Implement centralized logging and business intelligence
4. **Disaster Recovery and Failover** - Design resilient multi-region systems

Each use case includes:
- Detailed business scenarios and technical requirements
- Comprehensive learning objectives
- Success metrics for performance, cost, and reliability
- AWS service constraints and mitigation strategies
- Week-by-week action plans for hands-on practice

## How to Use These Resources

These materials are designed to complement the main training phases outlined in the [repository README](../README.md). They are particularly valuable for:

- **Phase 4 Trainees**: Use these as practical exercises to apply scaling and optimization concepts
- **Self-Study**: Work through use cases independently to build cloud architecture skills
- **Group Learning**: Collaborate with peers on use case implementations and share learnings
- **Portfolio Building**: Complete implementations demonstrate practical AWS experience to employers

## Contributing

As you work through these materials, consider:
- Documenting your implementation approaches
- Sharing lessons learned with fellow trainees
- Suggesting improvements to existing use cases
- Proposing new use cases based on emerging technologies
